About This Game

This project is based on the TileVania game from the "C# Unity Game Developer 2D" course. While the core idea and structure come from the course, I wrote a large portion of the code myself. For example, whenever the instructor introduced a new feature—like enemy logic—I paused the video and implemented it on my own before continuing.

I also added features that weren't included in the original course project, such as a bow and arrow shooting mechanic.
